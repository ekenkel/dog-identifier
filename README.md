# Dog Identifier

&nbsp;

[Open Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ekenkel/dog-identifier)



I created a model using fastai and pytorch that can recognize 146 breeds of dogs.

I used the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/) to get the breeds, then collected 110 images for each using [Bing Search API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-web-search/). Due to memory restrictions, I could not increase the dataset.


I randomly split the data:
- 80% training set
- 20% validation set

After resizing the images to be 128 x 128 px, I trained using the ConvNeXt-22k convolution neural network and 18 epochs.
