# Dog Identifier

I created a model using fastai and pytorch that can recognize 4 different types of dogs:
- Golden Retriever
- German Shepherd
- Dobermann
- Poodle



Based on 200 images of each, I randomly split the data:
- 80% training set
- 20% validation set

After resizing the images to be 128 x 128 px, trained using the ResNet Architecture with 18 layers.
